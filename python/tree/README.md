# Trees

## Challenge 18/11 cc15
create the binary tree and the binary search tree

## Approach & Efficiency
using recursive function inside the method itself

## API
### Binary Tree
1. pre_order: return the tree nodes in the following sequence: Root-Left-Right
2. in_order: return the tree nodes in the following sequence: Left-Root-Right
3. post_order: return the tree nodes in the following sequence: Left-Right-Root

### Binary Search Tree
1. Add: add nodes to the search tree depending on the value relative to the node value.
2. Contains: check wether the inserted value exists in the tree
 

## Challenge 21/11 cc16
new method to find the max value

## Approach & Efficiency
get the nodes array and loop it to find the maxiimum value

## API
### max_value
checks wether the root value isnt None
then gets the tree nodes array amd loop it to find the maximum value in that array!
