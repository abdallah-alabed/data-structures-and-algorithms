### Challenge
create a function that takes in two binary trees and return the nodes that are repeated in both of the binary trees

### Approach & Efficiency
**Big0:** \
Time  Complexity: \
O(n)
> because we loop through the list of words

Space Complexity: \
O(1)  
> No Extra Spaces in the memory were used!
